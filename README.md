## Simple start

To make this more simple to start, I have add a shell script `start.sh`, so bassically, we just navigate into this project folder and run that in the terminal:

```shell
./start.sh
```

this script will start documetation on port 4201 and open it in the browser, after that it will start the development server on default angular port 4200 and also open it in the browser.

Note: please make sure this file is executable:

  ```shell
  ls -la
  ```

  output:

  ```shell
  -rwxrwxrwx   1 user  group   204B Oct 10 16:50 start.sh
  ```

  if not, just run:

  ```shell
  chmod 777 start.sh
  ```
