  <a href="#overview"></a>Updating &nbsp;<strong>Metornic</strong>&nbsp;
</h1>
<div class="py-4">
  Like all HTML templates, you will need to manually handle all updates that we
  provide after purchase for free. The best practice is to always keep
  Metornic's source folder on an entire separate folder within your project and
  then use Metornic as a development companion or support.
</div>
<div class="py-4">
  Each update should be used independently without mixing it with the previous
  versions. This is because new updates may not have a 100% backward
  compatibility for elements within previous versions. Therefore, each update is
  considered as a new and better version of the theme.
</div>
<div class="pt-4">
  Here's our recommended steps needed to update Metornic effectively:
  <ol class="py-3">
    <li class="py-2">
      Backup all your files (your project folder and Metornic's's older
      version).
    </li>
    <li class="py-2">
      Review Metornics changelog to have a quick preview on what has been
      updated.
    </li>
    <li class="py-2">
      Unzip the latest version of Metornic and then browse through the elements
      (layout, widgets, plugins, etc) that you have used on your project.
    </li>
    <li class="py-2">
      Get the latest version use it instead the previous version.
    </li>
    <li class="py-2">
      Run<code>yarn install</code>task to update 3rd party plugins with their
      latest versions.
    </li>
    <li class="py-2">
      Compare your project's code vs the latest version of Metornics code for
      the used elements.
    </li>
    <li class="py-2">
      Manually replace the element HTML, CSS or TS where necessary.
    </li>
    <li class="py-2">
      Save and test your project files with Metornic's updated elements.
    </li>
  </ol>
  If something goes wrong, you can revert your updates by reusing your backup
  files.
